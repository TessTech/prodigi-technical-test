Langaues and frameworks used:
html
Sass converted to CSS
TypeScript and JQuery converted to JavaScript
Bootstrap

Changes to the mock-up:
I have altered the design to make the design of the reuired _ more consistant
I have also moved the lengend of the '_ Required' after the checkboxes so that it apperas after the 'terms and conditions' checkbox where I have also added it.

Layout of the files and folders:
I have laid out my files in folders in a way that is more saclable for websites for my Sass and TypeScript
eg inside my Sass folder I have sub folders to sort through my Sass (eg color.sass) and then I import them all to main.sass.
The same for the way I tried to link my TypeScript code between three files(WRITE NAMES HERE)
I have not been successful in linking these files correctly so instead I have one Sass and one TypeScript file that are running the code.
I have left the rest there to demonstrate that I have some understanding of how to layout folders

The files that are being used:
HTML: src\html\pages\sign-up.html
TyeScript and JQuery: src\ts\greeter.ts
The converted JavaScript: src\ts\greeter.js
Where the JQuery is saved: src\html\pages\jquery-3.5.1.min.js
Sass: src\sass\globals\utility\sign-up.sass
The converted CSS: src\sass\globals\utility\sign-up.css

What the TypeScript will allow you to do on the page:
PLAN I will email Stuart a short video demonstrating these.
If the required fields and not filled in/ ticked when you press the sign up button then an error message will appear under that input.
If the passwords do not match when the sign up button is pressed then an error message will appear under the create password input.
PLAN The sign up button will remain the pale purple until all of the required fields have been filled in.

To test Accessability, SEO, and Performance
I used the Lighthouse tab which appears when you inspect the code to run a report the scrores are
SEO
Perfeormance
Accessability
x
I also used the WAVE Chrome extension to check the accessability.
